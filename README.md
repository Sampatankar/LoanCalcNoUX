# LoanCalcNoUX
A basic vanilla JavaScript loan calculator without any UX enhancements

Derived from the Brad Traversy Modern JS Udemy course. Section 4: DOM projects.

This is a basic loan calculator, without any UE/UX enhancements that B.T. puts into the next stage of this project. I'm not a fan.

I have placed the code without UE enhancements in this folder, with updated comments and code corrections.

The loan calculator with enhancements is in another labelled repository.
